# Code Quiz

## Description
This application uses javascript to dynamically create HTML elements on a web page. The purpose of the application is to create a quiz on JavaScript that the user can take. When the button is clicked on the home page, the quiz is started. Then, a timer of 75 seconds begins that counts down during the quiz. If the time runs out before the user answers the last question, the quiz automatically ends. The user is shown a score based on how many questions they have answered correctly on the quiz. The user can enter their initials at the end of the quiz to save their initials and score to local storage. The highscores are then displayed on a highscores.html page. These scores can be cleared by deleting them from the local storage.
